# Welcome

Welcome to the **MetaMask Wallet API** documentation!

The MetaMask Wallet API enables you to:

- Connect web dApps to MetaMask browser extension
- Interact with users' Ethereum accounts
- Send transactions and sign messages
- Listen to account and network changes

The Wallet API allows you to interact with users' EVM accounts using standardized JSON-RPC calls. While you can connect to the MetaMask extension directly using just the Wallet API, we recommend using the SDK or third-party libraries in conjunction with the Wallet API, to take advantage of the SDK's benefits.

:::tip Looking for MetaMask SDK?
For **cross-platform** support including **mobile** apps and **advanced features**, check out the [**MetaMask SDK** docs](https://docs.metamask.io/sdk/).
